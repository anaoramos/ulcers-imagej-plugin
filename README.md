# Ulcer/Diabetic Foot Condition Detection with ImageJ Plugins

The Ulcer/Diabetic Foot Condition Detection project provides ImageJ plugins that enable the identification and analysis of ulcer and diabetic foot conditions based on image color analysis. The plugins utilize image processing algorithms to recognize different types of ulcers and diabetic foot conditions, including necrosis, fibrine, granulation, and unknown.

## Features

The ImageJ plugins offer the following features:

- **Ulcer Detection**: The plugins utilize image color analysis techniques to identify ulcers in medical images.

- **Diabetic Foot Condition Analysis**: By examining image color properties, the plugins can differentiate between necrosis, fibrine, granulation, and unknown diabetic foot conditions.

- **Image Processing Algorithms**: The plugins employ various image processing algorithms to enhance image quality and extract meaningful color information.
